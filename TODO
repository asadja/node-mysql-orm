Caching of returned rows (redis?)

Can we detect writes to fields and just store which rows to update somehow?
Time to get dirty with JS for real now...  I recall a __getter__ and __setter__
on MDN's documentation...

auto-values in the database, created when referenced and deleted when no
references remain.  Basically, many-to-many relationship with delete trigger. A
good trigger implementation is shown at in Erwin's answer:

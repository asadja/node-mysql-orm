Improve performance a little (see TODO notes in code).  Performance is low priority.

Multi-level lookups (all work to do will be in foreign-keys.js)

Define table-dependent prototypes for returned rows, so schema can define methods for them such as "fullName", "toString", "toHTML", etc.
In turn, base these on a prototype which supports "save", "delete", "lookupIds", "lookupValues", ...

Fix lit.js so it can read from STDIN, process code fragments in the documentation, etc.  Send pull requests to litjs upstream.  Regenerate docs with new awesome litjs.

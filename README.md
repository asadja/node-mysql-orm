node-mysql-orm
==============

For node.js: MySQL wrapper providing object mapping, automatic table generation via JSON schema, automatic foreign key generation and resolution, indexes, default values, reference options and more.

I'll write a proper README once all the basic functionality is in place, but for now use the documentation in the (hopefully) well-named .js files.  Or more preferably, wait another week for me to get the first release of this together!
